Frozen pizza is its own classification of pizza. It’s never going to taste like homemade pizza or delivery pizza (no matter what a _certain brand_ says in its ads)—and that’s okay. Sometimes, you want that slightly sweet sauce, that stretchy blanket of cheese, that smattering of pepperoni cubes. And it’s always smart to have a pizza or two in your freezer. You never know when the hunger will hit at 2 a.m. when all the delivery spots are closed, or at 5 p.m. when you’re faced with a “starving” child (or roommate) who refuses to wait longer than 25 minutes to eat. 

But which pizzas should you choose to grace your freezer shelves? That’s why _Sporked_ is here. We, along with actress and [Mythical](https://mythical.com/) office manager, Jasmine Williams ([@itsjasminew)](https://www.instagram.com/itsjasminew/), to taste through way too many frozen pizzas (turns out there _is_ an upper limit) to find the best. We assessed pizzas by considering what they were trying to do. Was it trying to be a crispy thin crust pie? Was it trying to be a crispy-edged Detroit-style ‘za? How well did it do it? Would this be satisfying in a nostalgic way? Would it scratch that doughy itch? These are some of the questions we all seriously posed as we sat around a conference table. And here are the answers. Here are the best frozen pizzas you can buy.

**Best of the Best**

**Motor City Detroit Style Supreme Deep Dish Pizza**

In my humble opinion, Detroit-style pizza is the best thing to happen to pizza since ranch dressing. With its high, doughy crust and cheesy, crispy edges, it provides a perfect base for a mound of toppings and is just plain satisfying in a way thin crust pizza never is. I was extremely dubious that a frozen pizza would come close to the real thing. But Motor City has cracked it. Pillowy and doughy? Check. Cheesy, crispy edges? Check. Generous topping distribution? Check. I’ve thought about this pizza multiple times since we tasted it. I will buy it with my own cash, which I earned by tasting this pizza.

**Best Thick Crust**

**DiGiorno Original Rising Crust Four Cheese**

“I have a DiGiorno bias,” Jasmine warned before taking a bite. “There’s just something about this that takes me home.” The sauce is definitely on the sweeter end, the cheese (a mix of mozzarella, Parmesan, asiago, and Romano) is a thick blanket, the crust is closer to doughy bread than anything you’d find at a New York pizzeria. If you’re looking for an authentic pizza experience, this will not satisfy your cravings. But if you’re looking for a cozy Snuggie of a meal, this classic frozen pizza is a great option. It’s not delivery. No one would ever think it was delivery. It’s DiGiorno, and that’s perfectly fine.

**Best Cheesy**

**Sam’s Choice Rising Crust 7 Cheese Pizza Stuffed Crust**

Take that, DiGiorno. Sam’s Choice sees your four cheese and raises you three. This extremely cheesy pizza (as in, if you’re lactose intolerant or even slightly nervous about dairy, turn back) features a blend of provolone, cheddar, fontina, Romano, Parmesan, and two types of mozzarella, all stuffed on top of the pizza and in the crust. “Is this too much cheese?” Jasmine posed. That would be a hard no from _Sporked_ writer [Jordan Myrick](https://sporked.com/article/author/jordanmyrick/). “I could even do more cheese,” she said. “I love her.” If you feel that too much cheese is still not enough cheese, then this is the pizza for you.

**Best Thin Crust**

**Tombstone Frozen Pepperoni Pizza**

“What do you want on your Tombstone?” It’s the key line from one of the first commercials I remember really locking onto as a kid. “How brilliant,” I thought. “They’re asking a man who is sentenced to death what he wants written on his grave marker and he’s responding with pizza toppings!” Literal gallows humor. It was a formative moment for me as someone who occasionally attempts to be funny. Now, did the pizza itself live up to that brilliant ad campaign? In a way, yes. This is the ultra-thin, crackery crust pizza most people think of when they picture frozen pizza. It’s the kind of pizza that you could fold in half and eat entirely by yourself as a pizza sandwich. Have one ready to go in your freezer, you’ll thank yourself later.

**Best Extremely Doughy**

**Great Value Rising Crust Pepperoni Pizza**

I was legitimately impressed by how much this crust rose in the oven. It puffed up like someone was inflating it with a bicycle pump. It _rose_. Eventually it settled down a bit, but the end result was still the most crust-forward pizza we tried. If you wish pizza was actually cheesy breadsticks, try Great Value’s offering. The sauce is rich and tangy. The crust is doughy to the max and deliciously buttery. You could lay your head on this pillow of a pizza and wake up to a delicious snack. You could and you should.

**Best Nostalgic**

**Screamin’ Sicilian Original Holy Pepperoni Frozen Pizza**

Jasmine noted that this pizza tasted like “arcade pizza” and it’s really the most apt tasting note I can think of. She went on to clarify that it specifically tasted like pizza from an “arcade in the middle of nowhere,” and then added, “I kind of like it.” Indeed, this is what nostalgia tastes like. After sitting out for a few minutes, the thin crust gets a tad soggy and the cheese layer solidifies. The sauce tastes like a standard marinara. And it is entirely satisfying. It tastes like you’re seven years old again, trying to score enough tickets to buy that knockoff Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper. (Uh oh, I just revealed my age.)

**Best Crunchy Crust**

**Jack’s Original Thin Crust Pepperoni Frozen Pizza**

If you power through the toppings and the cheese and the sauce just to get to a crispy, crunchy crust, then you should stock up on some Jack’s pizzas for your freezer. Honestly, the pizza part of the pizza was fine—your standard frozen pizza fare. But the crust was delectably crispy—akin to Domino’s crackery thin crust-style pizzas. It’s snappy and perfect for dipping into your choice of sauce.

## Rhett & Link’s Pick

### **DiGiorno Original Rising Crust Four Cheese**

In their blindfolded frozen pizza taste test on _[Good Mythical Morning](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4PooiX37Pld1T8J5SYT-SQ)_, Rhett & Link both rated DiGiorno’s classic cheese pizza at the top, with Link giving it a nine out of 10 and Rhett giving it an eight. Both also guessed the brand correctly, citing its “signature dough” and “plumpification.”
