Depending on who you ask, hummus has either never been better or never been worse. The flavored hummus trend is getting out of control. There’s [apple pie hummus](https://www.pavilions.com/shop/product-details.970122352.html), [Thai coconut curry hummus,](https://www.goodeggs.com/hopefoodssfbay/organic-thai-coconut-curry-hummus/5af0df4d06f683000fab35d5) [Buffalo-style hummus](https://www.tribehummus.com/flavors/buffalo-style.html), and a [brownie batter dessert hummus](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/delighted-by-brownie-batter-dessert-hummus-b01mxpxf3u) that I refuse to believe is either hummus _or_ brownie batter. Hummus is sliding into dip territory, and I don’t know if we can actually call that hummus. Can I add green beans, fried onions, and a can of mushroom soup to a chickpea puree and call it green bean casserole hummus? Moreover, if I did that, should I still be allowed to vote?

Hummus doesn’t need tricks or novel flavors. It doesn’t need your olives, your roasted red peppers, and surely not your chocolate. But Hummus doesn’t have to be bland either. There’s an elegant, flavorful simplicity to classic hummus that we enjoy. So, _Sporked_ organized a taste test of plain hummus. We looked for traditional flavor and texture. We wanted smooth, creamy hummus, and we wanted to be able to taste four key ingredients: chickpeas, tahini, garlic, and lemon. If the lemon tasted too much like citric acid, the hummus got docked points. If the tahini didn’t shine enough, docked points. If you put a picture of garlic on the package and it tasted nothing like garlic, docked points. Hummus is a delicate balance; it’s a marriage of great ingredients in one gorgeously simple spread. Mouth watering yet? Here’s our best-of list.

Best of the Best

**Whole Foods 365 Roasted Garlic Hummus**

This hummus rules. It skews into flavored territory with roasted garlic, but screw it, garlic is an ingredient in hummus so we allow it. The flavor here is superb. Roasted garlic has a deep garlicky flavor with none of the pungency of the raw stuff. The hummus itself is thick, not watery, and it’s got a nice balance of sesame flavor and lemon to boot. Really great stuff here. Roasted garlic should be in way more things.

Best Traditional

**Cava Traditional Hummus**

Cava hummus is creamy. You know a good whipped mashed potato with a ton of butter and milk? That gives you an idea of Cava hummus. The flavor here is perfectly balanced. You taste the nutty earthiness of the tahini, the tanginess from the lemon, and a subtle hint of garlic near the end. Also, this is one of the only brands of hummus where you can actually taste the chickpeas. This is great hummus; it’s a virtual tie with Whole Foods.

Best Fresh Hummus

**Ithaca Lemon Garlic Hummus**

Ithaca hummus is thick. This isn’t a droopy and watery spread like some other brands. If you’re scooping with pita chips, one is liable to break off into the brick-like container. Still, Ithaca has got an exceptionally lemony tang, garlicky bite, and nutty taste. Confidently spread this onto a sandwich and bring it to the beach or on a hike. Dip vegetables in it. Eat it with flatbread. Ithaca hummus goes with everything because it’s got serious flavor. Also, there’s no citric acid. The container tells you to “enjoy within seven days of opening.” This is as fresh as store-bought hummus gets.

Best Restaurant Quality

**Fresh n’ Nova Authentic Hummos**

There isn’t a real consensus on how to spell the word hummus, and this is the only “hummos” of the bunch. That might read a little more authentic, but does it actually taste that way? The answer is…mostly. This is great hummus. It’s creamy, nutty, and brightly acidic. This is exactly the type of hummus we expect when we sit down at a Lebanese restaurant. It’s got that beautiful hummus swirl, and there’s almost a hint of onion in this one that you’ll find attractive (although no onions are listed in the ingredients). Simply put, Fresh n’ Nova made our mouths water.

Best with Crudités

**Good & Gather Classic Hummus**

The flavor here is mostly lemon (see the ingredients: concentrated lemon juice and citric acid), but there’s still a lovely creaminess to Good & Gather (a Target brand) that makes it shine. Pairing the sharp acidity with some sweet carrots or crunchy cauliflower is a no-brainer. Good and Gather doesn’t score high marks in the tahini, garlic, or chickpea categories, but the tang here is wonderful and begs for raw vegetables.

Best Lunchbox Hummus

**Kirkland Organic Hummus**

This is portable hummus for the busy human or alien-inhabiting-a-human’s-body on the go. The flavor here is admittedly tame, but maybe that’s your thing. Plus, this is a lot of hummus for the price. Kirkland hummus would be a great lunch addition for any child or adult. Speaking of which, it blows my mind that kids now eat hummus for lunch. I grew up in Pennsylvania in the ‘90s. We ate frozen chicken patties slathered in mayonnaise, sheet tray pizza loaded with sugary tomato sauce, and strawberry milk. Man, that was actually good. What on earth happened to strawberry milk? Anyway, school lunch used to be lawless. But, hummus is healthy. We should all be eating hummus. Now excuse me while I Google where to buy strawberry milk.

**Best Sandwich Hummus**

**Tribe Classic Hummus**

Sure, Tribe Hummus did some really weird crap back in 2009 when they decided to make [pizza flavored hummus](https://vegnews.com/2009/9/tribe-pizza-hummus), but their classic hummus is pretty good. It’s tangy, creamy, and will do the job just fine. It’s thick and flavorful enough that you can throw it on a sandwich or wrap it in some flatbread. There’s also a subtle cumin flavor here that’s different from the rest. Sandwiches need spice, don’t ya know. If you like tangy hummus and spiced undertones, this is your brand.
