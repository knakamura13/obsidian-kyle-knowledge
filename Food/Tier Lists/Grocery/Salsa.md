Not to sound like a snob, but I do not typically buy brand name, store bought salsa. How could they ever compare to the pints of fresh salsa I can buy at my local burrito place? Or something I can whip up at home with vegetables from the farmers market?

But my snobbery was unwarranted and I should’ve realized that sooner. If you can have good jarred [marinara sauce](https://sporked.com/article/best-marinara-sauce/) or tomato chutney, why can’t you have good salsa from the store? I’m now a store bought salsa convert and I’m here to impart the knowledge I gained during this taste test to hopefully heal you of your store bought salsa snobbery too. [Vianai Austin](https://www.instagram.com/vianaiaustin/?hl=en) from _[Mythical Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXGR70CkW_pXb8n52LzCCRw)_ joined us to dip some chips and figure out what store bought red salsas felt fresh, flavorful, and authentic.

Best of the Best

**Casa Sanchez Foods Hot Salsa Roja**

Casa Sanchez Food Hot Salsa Roja was easily the most flavorful salsa we tasted during our extensive research. Each item from the minimal ingredient list of tomatoes, onions, peppers, and cilantro shines, while also seamlessly melding with the others to create the perfect restaurant-style salsa. The fact that this salsa comes from the refrigerator section makes it feel extra fresh. It’s not out of this world hot, but it has a nice kick. Casa Sanchez is perfecting store bought salsa.

Best Smoky

**Mateo’s Gourmet Mild Salsa**

I can’t believe I’m putting a mild salsa so high on the list, but Mateo’s Mild Gourmet Salsa definitely earned its spot. This salsa had, in my opinion, the perfect texture. It wasn’t completely liquified, but there weren’t any big chunks of cooked tomato either. It felt like a salsa that was made at home in a blender instead of something that was produced in a factory. It’s not named on the ingredient list, but I got a strong hit of cumin the second this salsa touched my tongue. Sometimes mild salsas end up being mild on flavor, but that is not the case here!

Best Chunky

**On The Border Medium Chunky Salsa**

Chunky salsas have to work extra hard to win me over because I’m not a fan of big, wet pieces of tomato. Luckily, On The Border Medium Chunky Salsa brought their A-game to the taste test and made a fan out of me. The first thing I noticed when I dipped my chip is that this salsa is super aromatic. I was warmly greeted by the scent of onion, garlic, and chilies. Another plus is that, unlike most jarred salsas, it doesn’t have a weird citric acid flavor. It tastes like there’s actually lime in it! This is an awesome alternative to homemade salsa if you’re in a pinch.

Best Medium

**Casa Sanchez Foods Medium Salsa Roja**

The Casa Sanchez Foods Medium Salsa Roja is almost as good as the hot. It is…just not as hot. The lower spice level pushes it down on the list because I prefer hot salsa and I’m the one writing this list! That being said, if you like the hot version of Casa Sanchez’s Salsa Roja, you’ll also like this medium version. It has a wonderfully textured but saucy mouthfeel and plenty of fresh onion-y, cilantro-y flavor. If you are a spice coward who wants to build your heat tolerance, this is a great medium to start with.

Best Mild

**Mission Medium Chunky Salsa**

I know that the Mission Medium Chunky Salsa explicitly states that it is a medium salsa. I would like to argue, though, that it is most certainly not. This salsa is very much a mild salsa. There’s almost zero heat. I’m not sure who in the world would consider this to be medium. And while Mission is wrong about the heat at which they’re categorizing their salsa, they are right about the flavor of their salsa. Its gentle tomato-y taste with hints of onion and cilantro make it perfect for the salsa novice in your family.

Most Nostalgic

**Pace Medium Chunky Salsa**

I can’t come across a jar of Pace salsa without thinking “New York City?!” so they get bonus points for effective advertising. To me, the wonder of Pace salsa is that it tastes familiar. I don’t want this salsa at a restaurant or from a taco truck, but I would thoroughly enjoy this salsa at a potluck-style baby shower for an acquaintance I don’t know that well. The sauce is weirdly but pleasantly thick, the flavor is extremely tomato-forward, and the energy is that of a sleepover I went to in the third grade. It’s not the best salsa, but it’s comforting.

Best for Cooking

**Bobby Salazar’s Medium Salsa**

First of all, I love the name: Bobby Salazar’s Salsa. It makes me feel like a person I know made this and gave it to me. “Whose salsa is this?” “It’s Bobby’s!” While the taste is fresh, the flavor of Mexican oregano is very strong. Too strong for me to want to eat it plain on a tortilla chip. I do, however, think this would be delicious for cooking. Toss this into a pan with some black beans and let it simmer, that’s soup! This in a crockpot with some chicken thighs? A perfect taco filling! Bobby Salazar, call me if you ever want to do a collab.
