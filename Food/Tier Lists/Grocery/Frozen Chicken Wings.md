Chicken wings are a tasty and chaotic mess. Nothing produces quite as many sauce-soaked napkins as devouring a dozen wings slathered in Buffalo sauce. It’s practically a crime scene. Oh, by the way, the little moist towelette restaurants give you with your order? Utterly useless. After I eat hot wings I need a bucket, a bar of soap, and a Buffalo Wild Wings staff member to spray me down with a garden hose. Not a wet origami napkin. Come on, now.

Good wings can be defined by two things: Crispy skin and juicy meat.. We also want flavor, whether that’s from a tangy Buffalo sauce, sweet honey BBQ, or just some plain, well-seasoned wings. Flavor has to show up to get a high score. I also want a wing that _feels_ like it’s been in the deep fryer. While that’s nearly impossible to achieve from frozen, store-bought wings, some of these brands actually get pretty darn close. Knowing our objectives, the _Sporked_ team rolled up our sleeves and sat down to try some of the top-selling frozen wing brands. We prepped the wings using an oven—but  you can use an air fryer and get different results. (Let us know what you find out! Slide into our DMs or tag us with @sporked.) 

We used up a bunch of paper towels and got into deep discussions about wings vs. flats (I won’t even touch that debate now), but we found seven of the best frozen chicken wings—possibly at the expense of my work computer. I’m typing this on my laptop with stained fingers and I’m pretty sure I’m going to need a new one. Anyway, please enjoy this frozen wing list.

Best of the Best

**Foster Farms Hot & Spicy**

These wings take the crown for their even balance of crispy texture, tender meat, and amazing flavor. It should also be said that these were the only wings to _not_ stick to the baking sheet. They were adequately crispy and evenly coated with sauce. That sauce, albeit not a traditional, buttery, restaurant-style Buffalo sauce, is tangy and hot just like I want it. Foster Farms Hot & Spicy wings uses aged cayenne peppers and a bit of vinegar to achieve that classically spicy, zesty flavor. This is a quality wing that scores high marks in both texture and flavor. For that reason, it alone sits in the top spot. After the taste test, I ate a few more of these over the office garbage can like only a garbage man can (nice).

Best Crispy

**TGIFridays Buffalo Style Wings**

These bone-in Buffalo wings can be pretty tough to find, but when you see them at a store, get a tattoo of the exact location so that you never forget. These wings are _perfectly crispy_—astonishingly so. Even when we cooked them in an oven, they achieved an incredible crunch. The only knock on these wings is that there’s not a _whole_ lot of Buffalo sauce flavor. What sauce it _does_ have permeates the chicken, though. “The sauce feels like it’s baked into the wing,” _Sporked_ editor-in-chief [Justine Sterling](https://sporked.com/article/author/justinesterling/) said glowingly. That said, you might need to apply your own Frank’s Red Hot here. Still, achieving crispy wings without using an air fryer is a feat, which makes TGIFriday’s Buffalo Style Wings a superb 8.5 out of 10. If you ranked them higher, I would totally understand.

Best Plain

**Foster Farms Take Out Crispy Classic Buffalo Wings**

These wings come with Buffalo sauce, which you might not even need. Foster Farms wings are _perfect_ naked and plain; they are salty, meaty, and moist all by themselves. _Sporked_ staff writer [Jordan Myrick](https://sporked.com/article/author/jordanmyrick/) enjoyed these so much she said, “I kind of forgot I was on camera for a minute,” as she got lost in the taste. (Want to see her and the rest of us _Sporked_ folks taste test in action? Check out our [TikTok](http://www.tiktok.com/@sporked) or [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/sporked).) That’s the first time I’ve heard her say that since we started working here, so, I’m inclined to think these are very good. Well-seasoned food wins out every time, and these Foster Farms wings score high because of it.

Best with Blue Cheese

**Tyson Buffalo Style Hot Wings**

Not to be confused with the Tyson’s Any’tizers Buffalo Style Wings, these Tyson wings have a loud Buffalo flavor that we enjoy. The tangy heat also provides a bit more spiciness than the other wings on this list, making them all the more delectable. The wing meat is no joke, either. These aren’t dry and thin; Tyson’s Buffalo Style Hot Wings feature big, honkin’ hunks of juicy wing meat. Meaty hot wings are a no-brainer to pair with a good blue cheese dressing, just like the good Lord intended. The skin on each wing is nice and craggy, too, with an even coating around every morsel of chicken. Everything is super solid, Tyson wings just need some blue cheese to really bring it home.

Best with Ranch

**Tyson Any’Tizers Buffalo Wings** 

These are darker than TGIFriday’s Buffalo wings and bigger, too. They’re pretty standard, and should have more Buffalo flavor, but you can take care of that on your own if need be. (Want a Buffalo sauce recommendation? We’ve got you covered.) The meat is really good. It’s gorgeously white and flavorful. The crisp is pretty good, too. The flavor on these is mild, and blue cheese might be a little too sweet and cheesy for something that doesn’t pack a ton of flavor. Instead, I’d pair these with some tangy, herb-speckled ranch (probably one of the [best ranch dressings](https://sporked.com/article/best-ranch-dressing/)) to make up for the slight lack of flavor.

Best Buffalo Sauce

**Kirkwood Buffalo Style Chicken Wings**

“The meat tastes like it was marinated in garlic, almost like it’s brined,” remarked Justine. She was a big fan of the flavor here, but not of the texture of the wing. Kirkwood wings are curious. The flavor here is great, it contains the correct amount of sharp heat you come to expect out of Buffalo sauce, but the texture is a little peculiar. I think it’s a good move to mess around with the cooking process to get the right texture. Jack up the heat or put them under the broiler at the end of the cooking process for a minute or two if you have to.

Best Honey BBQ

**Tyson Any’Tizers Wings Honey BBQ Seasoned**

These wings are sweet and tangy, just like you want out of a good honey BBQ sauce. The sugar in the honey is also an added textural bonus, as it creates these crispy little edges on the wings themselves after they come out of the oven. These come fully cooked, so all you have to do is reheat them. That said, I would consider cooking these in the oven at a higher temperature than suggested. We cooked them to package directions and they were just fine, but the wings could have been a lot crispier. Enjoy the flavor and the tasty white meat, but it might take some noodling with the oven to get the right texture.
