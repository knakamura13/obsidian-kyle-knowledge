Are any chicken nuggets prepared at home as good as fast food chicken nuggets? That’s what I wanted to find out as we set out to find the best frozen chicken nuggets. I have eaten approximately 500,000 Wendy’s spicy chicken nuggets, but I’ve never, personally, prepared a nugget. And why would I? Chicken nuggets are almost free at the drive-through. That being said, I love not leaving my house, so grocery store chicken nuggets definitely have some appeal.

_[Good Mythical Morning](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4PooiX37Pld1T8J5SYT-SQ)_ writer and chicken nugget lover [Kalyn French](https://www.instagram.com/kamasemicolon/) joined us to make sense of the frozen chicken nugget market and craft this list so you will never buy a bad frozen chicken nugget ever again.

**Best** of the Best

**Fast Fixin’ Chicken Breast Nuggets**

Fast Fixin’ Chicken Breast Nuggets were breathtakingly flavorful. Not only was the coating properly seasoned, the meat had a rich, savory “chicken juice sort of flavor” (Kalyn’s perfect description, not mine). These are one of the few brands of nuggets I’ve ever eaten that, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, might not…need…sauce? I will still dip them, but you don’t need to smother them in sauce to make them flavorful like most other store-bought nuggets. Of the nuggets we tried, these came the closest to tasting like a Wendy’s nugget (the best fast food nugget, in my opinion).

**Best Crunch**

**Tyson Panko Chicken Nuggets**

_Sporked_ editor-in-chief [Justine Sterling](https://sporked.com/article/author/justinesterling/) loved these because they felt the most McDonald’s-y of all the brands we tried. If you, too, worship at the altar of the golden arches, buy these Tyson Panko Chicken Nuggets. The panko (aka Japanese breadcrumbs) gives them extra crunch, which perfectly compliments the juicy chicken center. Looking for that real fast food crunch? Toss these in the air fryer. All you need is hot mustard and, voila, you’re Ronald McDonald.

**Best for Dipping**

**Bell & Evans Breaded Chicken Breast Nuggets**

If you want Chik-fil-A nuggets without having to patronize Chik-fil-A, say hello to Bell & Evans Breaded Chicken Breast Nuggets. Unlike processed, formed nuggets, these are just big hunks of chicken in a light breading. Some of our tasters argued that these aren’t technically nuggets because of their shape, but I don’t care about that and I’m the one writing this article. Their flavor is mild, so they are ideal for dipping in the nugget sauce of your choice. I can’t wait to get these into some Buffalo ranch.

**Best Fast Food at Home**

**Pilgrim’s Tempura Chicken Breast Nuggets**

While all our nuggets were reminiscent of different fast food establishments, the Pilgrim’s Tempura Chicken Breast Nuggets were the most like the kind you’re handed in a paper bag through your car window. These have a deep, rich dark-meat flavor that is way more complex than some of the other nuggets we tested. If you are addicted to fast food but need to cut down on your spending, fill your fridge with these.

**Best Budget**

**Great Value Breaded Chicken Nuggets**

As per usual, Great Value is doing great things. They’ve made it possible to buy so many delicious little nuggets for such a low price. If you’re having a birthday party for your third grader and inviting their whole class, two bags of these will do the trick. They’re more like popcorn chicken than full-sized nuggets, so they are the perfect size for tiny little hands. They’re crunchy and savory and meaty and oh so affordable.

When Rhett & Link did their very own frozen chicken nugget taste test, they determined that the Tyson All Natural Fully Cooked Chicken Nuggets were their favorite. Rhett said he “could eat a whole plate of these.” They beat out Perdue with their crunchy texture and fun orange coloring. Link liked that “they don’t hide the \[natural nugget\] flavor with pepper.” If you’re looking for a straightforward, meat-focused chicken nugget, check these out!
