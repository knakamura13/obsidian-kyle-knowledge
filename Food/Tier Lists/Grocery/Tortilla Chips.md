Tortilla chips are the unsung heroes of the chip world. They do so much for us and get so little respect. Unlike potato chips, tortilla chips are rarely eaten alone. They are forgotten about as a solo snack and only taken seriously if accompanied by [salsa](https://sporked.com/article/best-store-bought-salsa/), [guacamole](https://sporked.com/article/best-guacamole/), or queso.

When the _Sporked_ team sat down to taste through the best options, though, I learned that all tortilla chips are different, like beautiful, salty, corny snowflakes. What makes a great tortilla chip, in my opinion, is structural sturdiness, fried flavor, and proper salt distribution. [Kristian Rodriguez](https://www.instagram.com/stonetapt/), [Mythical](https://mythical.com/)’s studio operations coordinator, joined us to crunch through every brand of tortilla chips we could find. Here are the ones that should make their way to your pantry:

Best of the Best

**On The Border Café Style Tortilla Chips**

The On The Border Cafe Style Tortilla Chips are literally the perfect tortilla chips. They are sturdy without being too thick. They have a mild corn flavor that makes them feel homemade rather than mass-produced. They are salty enough to make the chip great for eating on its own, but are also mild enough to not overpower whatever you’re dipping them into. Most surprising, they smell and taste like they’re fresh out of the fryer, like canola oil in the best way. I didn’t know this freshly fried flavor was even possible for a packaged item, but now that I know, I can’t unknow—you know?

Best Salted

**Great Value Bite Size Tortilla Chips**

In the search for the best tortilla chips, I was shocked to discover that most companies are under-salting their tortilla chips. Why?! Salt is one of the most vital attributes a tortilla chip brings to the table. Not to worry, though: Great Value Bite Size Tortilla Chips are here to save the day. They are perfectly salted bites of crunchy goodness. Plus, unlike the classic triangular chip, the circular shape of Great Value chips means they will fit into any salsa, guac, or queso container,  making them the perfect partner for a prepackaged dip.

Best Authentic

**Juanita’s Tortilla Chips**

The highlight of Juanita’s Tortilla Chips is their puffy, light, and airy texture. They feel like the love child of a handmade corn tortilla and a cumulus cloud. These might not stand up to a loaded Austin-style queso, but their delicate features make them perfect for gliding through a light salsa verde. If you’re a dipper or dunker, rather than a scooper, Juanita’s is the way to go.

Best for Salsa Lovers

**Tostitos Scoops! Tortilla Chips**

Tostitos Scoops! are my tortilla chips of choice because my main goal when eating tortilla chips is to get as much salsa into my mouth as possible in a single bite. Anyone who agrees a chip is just a vehicle for  dip should see Scoops! as the Rolls-Royce Dawn Drophead of tortilla chips. Each Scoop! holds a sensational amount of sauce. They’re like tiny, edible bowls that cradle the delicious dip of your choosing as it travels to face. Scoops! are what happens when practicality meets whimsy and I just love them. Thank you, Tostitos engineers, for inventing these.

Best Flavored

**Late July Snacks Restaurant Style Jalapeño & Lime Tortilla Chips**

I do not like Hint of Lime Tostitos (well, I _didn’t_ like them—keep reading to find out how that changed). My disdain has grown past Hint of Lime and has expanded to any and all lime-flavored tortilla chips—until I met LATE JULY Jalapeño & Lime Tortilla Chips. These are authentically limey and have a nice, fruity, jalapeño bite. These sing when you dip them into guacamole or salsa, rather than scream like Tostitos Hint of Lime. That being said, these are probably the only tortilla chips I could still enjoy eating sans dip.

Best Flavored Runner Up

**Tostitos Hint of Lime Tortilla Chips**

The first Hint of Lime tortilla chip I tried during our tasting confirmed my preexisting feelings: These are bad. Then I kept eating them for some reason. By my third handful of chips, my mind was forever changed. These are very good. Okay, not as good as Late July, but still good. Don’t show up to a bag of Tostitos Hint of Lime Tortilla Chips expecting fresh flavor. Instead, accept that these are their own thing. _Sporked_ editor-in-chief [Justine Sterling](https://sporked.com/article/author/justinesterling/) referred to the flavor as a “bottle of lime juice you find in your parent’s fridge that’s been in there for who knows how long.” In a good way.

Best for Nachos

**Trader Joe’s Yellow Corn Tortilla Chips**

One crunch of the Trader Joe’s Yellow Corn Tortilla Chips and you will be transported to the stands of your brother’s little league game, munching on nachos smothered with canned cheese sauce. I don’t have any brothers and I’ve never been to a little league game, but these chips inserted that false memory into my brain. They are extremely crunchy and very corny, making them perfect for holding too much molten cheese. If you want to take a trip to 1997, chomp on these.
