Everybody has their own preference when it comes to guacamole. There’s the old school (like, before the 16th century old school), minimalist guac that’s just coarsely mashed avocados, lime, and salt, which wows with simplicity and pure avocado flavor. Then there’s chunky guac studded with aromatics, chile, and tomato—though that opens the door for people to get picky about what _doesn’t_ go in it.

Some people are offended by onions. Others think tomatoes are a crime. Are habaneros too spicy for a crowd? Can I dip my entire sandwich in there or will that upset everybody? Plus, god forbid you use cilantro when hosting one of those poor souls out there who are doomed to taste soap. 

Luckily, the team here at _Sporked_ all seemed to agree about what we want in our guacamole. For a proper taste test, we invited _[Mythical Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXGR70CkW_pXb8n52LzCCRw)_’s culinary director and guac enthusiast, [Nicole Enayati](https://www.instagram.com/nicolehendizadeh/?hl=en), to the _Sporked_ conference room. As we dipped our [tortilla chips](https://sporked.com/article/best-tortilla-chips/), we looked for specific flavors and textures. We want our guacamole to taste like avocado. It should be earthy, buttery, and deliciously ripe. We also want a great deal of flavor, whether it be from onions, garlic, lime juice, or a little bit of heat. That flavor has to be balanced, too. It shouldn’t upstage the mighty avocado. The guacamole also has to be well salted. Blandness is a sin. Finally, we want our guacamole to be coarse, not totally smooth—bonus points for visible chunks of avocado. Lastly, guacamole should be _creamy_. It shouldn’t be the least bit runny (look, you’d be surprised what companies pass for guac around here).

So pull up a chair, some chips, and read the _Sporked_ scoop on store-bought guacamole.

Best of The Best

**Hope Foods Spicy Green Chile Guacamole**

This guacamole is deeply flavorful, spicy, and creamy. That’s why it takes our top spot. The kick of heat and subtle garlic bite doesn’t overpower the avocado itself, which is nice and thick. “The avocado really sings in this one,” Nicole said during our tasting. The habanero is spicy and fruity, and the green chile provides another layer of mild heat. This guacamole is complex without overdoing it. And due to the organic ingredients, the flavors are natural, too. There’s no overly acidic taste from citric acid. It’s just organic lime juice, cilantro, green chile, habanero, garlic, onion, and tomato. That’s as good as it gets for a store-bought guacamole. Take your crown, Hope Foods.

Best Chunky

**Trader Joe’s Chunky Homestyle Guacamole**

TJ’s just makes good guac, including this version featuring some big a\*\* chunks of avocado. “Nothing like a good hunk,” Nicole quipped. There’s a nice bit of heat and herbaceousness with Trader Joe’s Chunky Homestyle guacamole. It’s one of the few where you can actually taste the cilantro. In addition, Trader Joe’s guacamole _feels_ like it was made fresh. It’s creamy, chunky, and has a nice sharp flavor. We also appreciate this guac for its rough chunks of avocado and appropriate amount of salt. It was just shy of the best. Buy it and don’t think twice.

Best for Avocado Toast

**Trader Joe’s Avocado’s Number Guacamole**

Trader Joe’s standard guacamole is smooth and creamy, making it a good choice for avocado toast. And let’s face it, if you’re shopping at Trader Joe’s you _love_ avocado toast. _Sporked_ staff writer [Jordan Myrick](https://sporked.com/article/author/jordanmyrick/) pointed out, “It’s fake, but the good kind of fake. You know how _I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter_ tastes more like butter than butter? That’s Trader Joe’s guacamole.” There is a rich, buttery quality to this guacamole that feels true to the spirit of a fresh avocado. We’ve said it before, we’ll say it again: Trader Joe’s makes good guac.

Best Guacamole for Beer

**Good Foods Chunky Guacamole**

Good Foods chunky guacamole is the pretzels of guac, with a great saltiness (one of the few on this list to nail the salt) that pairs well with beer. Sipping a cold one while you eat tortilla chips blessed with guacamole is charming as hell. This one comes loaded, too. Good Foods features chunks of red onions, white onions, jalapeños, tomatoes, and garlic. It’s got bar snack and big game written all over it. This would be a fun guac to pair with some spicy chips if you want to get nuts (I mean let’s get nuts, right?).

Best Secret Ingredient

**Homeboy Authentic Guacamole**

We love the unique taste of tomatillo here, which adds a tangy, sweet, citrusy flavor that is refreshing and bright. It’s a better addition than the bland, frequently used out-of-season red tomatoes, which can often be tart and sour. Tomatillos are a little more consistent. While Homeboy doesn’t have a ton of acidity up front, it hits enough on the back end to get by. The flavors here are subtle, but that means the avocado shines brighter.

Nicole’s Pick

**Wholly Guacamole Classic**

“This feels like going to my friend’s house on a Wednesday,” Nicole said. Holy Guacamole is a constant in the store-bought guacamole realm, and it’s got a steady, relatively inoffensive taste. The flavors are all there—avocado, lime, and onion—plus it doesn’t have that intense citric acid aftertaste. You might want to add a touch of salt and pepper on your own, but that’s not a huge problem. This is entry level guac for a lot of people, which is why it’s our nostalgic pic. Nicole finished her thought, “This takes me back to high school, and I like food that can do that.” So do we.
